/**
 * Merges what this tab is about to write with what is already in storage.
 *
 * `ff-uploads` is one key shared by every tab of the origin, and zustand's
 * persist rewrites the whole of it from this tab's own `files` after every
 * `set` -- so without this, a tab that is only *watching* another tab's upload
 * publishes its own frozen copy of that row over the live one. Measured: a
 * store holding tab A's row as `elsewhere` with a three-minute-old stamp, and
 * `ff-uploads` freshly stamped by A less than two seconds ago; one ordinary
 * `setPanelOpen(true)` in tab B rolled the stored stamp back three minutes, and
 * the very next sweep called the transfer interrupted. The row left the Active
 * group for Failed, gained Resume and Discard, and never came back.
 *
 * Two rules, and both are the same idea: a row belongs to the tab that is
 * sending it.
 *
 *  * A row this tab does not own is kept as stored whenever the stored copy was
 *    stamped at least as recently. This tab has nothing newer to say about it.
 *  * A row that is in storage and not in this tab's state at all is kept, as
 *    long as another tab is still stamping it. Otherwise one tab's write erases
 *    another tab's in-flight row outright -- and if that tab then dies, history
 *    answers with the display version, which skips `uploading`, so a second
 *    version's upload has no row anywhere and no offer to resume.
 *
 * A row this tab owns is always written as this tab has it: nobody else is in a
 * position to know better.
