          compete with the org name for the 48px logo header. Renders nothing
          when an admin turns "Powered by FreeFrame" off.

          Not on the asset viewer. That route carries its own credit in the top
          bar it renders in place of the header, so the floating one was a
          second copy -- and at 173px wide it covered the 28px send button in
          the corner of the comment composer completely, so every click on Send
          opened the repository in a new tab instead of posting the comment.
          Enter still posted, which is why it went unseen.

          The viewer's own copy is hidden below `lg`, where it would push the
          bar's controls off the screen. Nothing takes its place there: bringing
          this one back would restore the send-button collision on exactly the
          widths where the composer is hardest to hit. */}
