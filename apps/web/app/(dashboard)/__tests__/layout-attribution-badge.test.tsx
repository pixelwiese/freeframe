/**
 * The floating attribution badge must not render on the asset viewer.
 *
 * It is `fixed` in the bottom-right corner of the whole dashboard at 173x30,
 * and the asset viewer puts the comment composer's 28x28 send button in that
 * same corner. The badge is an `<a href>` and won it outright:
 * `elementsFromPoint` at the button's own centre returned the badge's span and
 * anchor above the button, so every click on Send opened the repository in a
 * new tab and the comment was never posted. Enter still posted it, which is
 * why this shipped in #264 and went unnoticed until #356.
 *
 * The viewer renders its own credit in its top bar, so gating here removes a
 * duplicate rather than dropping the attribution -- and both copies read the
 * same branding flag, so an admin who turns the credit off still loses it
 * everywhere. (Below `lg` the viewer hides its copy, because in flow it costs
 * the bar's controls; this one stays gated there rather than filling the gap,
 * since it would land back on the send button.)
