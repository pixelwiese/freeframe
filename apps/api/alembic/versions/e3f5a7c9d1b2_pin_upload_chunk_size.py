"""pin the multipart chunk size per upload

A resume has to place part N at exactly the byte range the parts already in the
bucket were cut on. That range is derived from the chunk size, which until now
lived only as a constant in the web bundle -- so an upload interrupted before a
release and resumed after one that changed the constant would write parts that
overlap or leave gaps, and R2 additionally requires every non-final part to be
the same size.

Recording it at initiate makes it a property of the upload rather than of
whatever build the browser happens to be running.
