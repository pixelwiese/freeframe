"""Discarding an upload is not the same as one that failed.

A plain abort marks the version `failed`, which is right for a transfer that
gave up and wrong for one somebody threw away on purpose: the asset then carries
a red "Failed" badge in the version switcher for an upload nobody wanted. And
when the object happens to be assembled, abort takes its own branch and
*publishes* it -- so the one control that exists to discard an upload did the
opposite. Found by hand on a dev instance.

These run against real Postgres, and they check what was *committed*, not what
the session happens to hold. The storage deletes go out before the commit, so a
lost commit is not a no-op: the endpoint would answer 204 with the bytes gone
and the version row still live, pointing at nothing. A session that reads its
own unflushed writes cannot see that, which is how an earlier MagicMock version
of this file stayed green with the commit replaced by `pass`.
