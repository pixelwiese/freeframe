"""Tests for GET /upload/{version_id}/parts, which is what makes a resume possible.

The endpoint answers "what does the backend already hold for this upload", so the
client can send the rest instead of the lot. Two properties carry the weight:
a part only counts as held when its *size* matches what this upload cuts parts
at, and the chunk size the client is told to use comes from the server rather
than from its own constant.
