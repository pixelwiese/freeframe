"""Stream copy has to reach the ffmpeg command, and only where it is allowed.

Two mistakes are possible here and both are silent. One is the setting doing
nothing, so an instance that turned it on still spends an hour per master. The
other is the opposite and worse: copying a source that should have been encoded,
which produces an asset that plays for nobody -- 10-bit H.264 reports the same
codec name as the 8-bit kind, and an HDR master copied without tone-mapping is
grey. So every test here reads the command that was actually built, and the ones
that must *not* copy outnumber the ones that must.
