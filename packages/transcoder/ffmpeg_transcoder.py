        A stream copy hands the segmenter whatever random-access points the
        master already carries, so they have to be points a player can actually
        start at. Two ways they are not:

        * **They are not IDRs.** An open-GOP master marks its later
          random-access points with a recovery-point SEI instead, and a segment
          beginning there carries neither the parameter sets nor a clean decode
          point -- every segment after the first decodes to `non-existing PPS 0
          referenced`. Nothing about this fails loudly: the parameter sets live
          in segment 0, so playback from the top works and the job reports
          success. What breaks is seeking, which is what a comment's timecode
          and the scrubber's hover preview both are, and in a review tool
          seeking is the product.
        * **They are too far apart.** `-hls_time` is a floor here, so the
          master's own spacing decides how long a segment is.

        Bounded to the first `_COPY_PROBE_SECONDS`: one range read rather than a
        second pass over a 4 GB master, on the reasoning that an encoder does
        not change its GOP structure halfway through a file. A master whose
        first window holds fewer than two sync samples is refused rather than
        guessed at, which is the same answer the segment-length bound gives.

        Anything that goes wrong in here refuses the copy. A refusal costs
        encode time, which is the thing this setting exists to save; the other
        direction costs an asset nobody can seek in, which is worse.
